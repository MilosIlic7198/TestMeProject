# TestMeProject
This is a app for testing students which would serve instructors at coding schools, high schools, faculties etc.

NOTE: This project is not finisht yet!!! I will be adding: Java Socket Programing, and Concurrent Programing.

Technologies used: Java, MYSQL

The project contains: Java Core and Data Structures, Java Swing GUI, JDBC, MYSQL(database programing).

Design patterns used: Singleton, Data Access Object Pattern, Facade Pattern.

When starting the application itself, the user is offered to signin.

1. If the user is a student, the application will open a student frame for that specific student.
2. If the user is a instructor, the application will open a instructor frame for that specific instructor.
3. If the user is a admin, the application will open a admin frame for that specific admin.

Creating an account on the application can only be done by admin.
Admin is the one who will give access modifiers to accounts.

Instructor can create test for their students and grade submitted test.

Students can take the tests provided by their instructor and submit them when they are finished working on the test.

Tests are dynamically created components because every test in different.
Submitted test questions are automatically checked for correctness or incorrectness to help the instructor make a better decisione.

This is my full database design:
